  Functional Summary
      vaccine.py demonstrates how we can
      use vaccine data to track the progress and speed of the vaccine distributions within the senior population

     Commandline Parameters: 1
        argv[0] = data file
        argv[1] = csv file

#
#   Packages and modules

# The 'sys' module gives us access to system tools, including the
# command line parameters, as well as standard input, output and error
import sys

import csv

#
# Define any "constants" for the file here.
# Names of constants should be in UPPER_CASE.
#
# This is a dictionary -- a data structure that associates
# values (in this case integers) with names.
