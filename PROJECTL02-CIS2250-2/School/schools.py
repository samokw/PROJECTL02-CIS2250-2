  Functional Summary
      schools demonstrates how we can
      use school covid cases and testing data to analyze the current trends in Covid-19 daily

     Commandline Parameters: 1
        argv[0] = data file
        argv[1] = csv file

# The 'sys' module gives us access to system tools, including the

# Define any "constants" for the file here.
# Names of constants should be in UPPER_CASE.
#
# This is a dictionary -- a data structure that associates
